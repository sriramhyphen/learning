# Introduction

The author aims to establish cognitive load as a key if not the one true metric of evaluating good code. The author demonstrates this with practical examples.

# What is cognitive load

* The average person can hold about 4 facts in their brain at any given time. _Note: This is not a proven fact, but rather an approximation. The more accurate way of thinking about this would be, that every human being has a finite amount of facts that they can hold in their brain at any given time._
